# Hello, I'm Sophie
## Introduction
ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Sophie, a dedicated data scientist and enthusiast with a passion for working with big data. Leveraging my technical skills in Python, R, SQL, and machine learning, I'm committed to informing data-driven business decisions that drive improvements in organizational health and performance.

## Objective
This portfolio showcases my data science projects, demonstrating my expertise in data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization. Each project includes detailed explanations, code snippets, and insights derived from the data. The objective is to illustrate my ability to solve real-world problems using data-driven approaches.

## Project Overview

### [1. Credit Card Default Prediction Model](https://github.com/sobinahn1/DS_Portfolio/tree/main/Credit_Card_Default_Prediction)
- **Description:** Identify the risk associated with clients defaulting on credit card payments due, enabling more informed decision-making and effective risk management.
- **Techniques:** Machine Learning (classification models), Parameter Tuning, Feature Engineering
- **Tools:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Highlights:** Increase the model performances by 20% on average, concluding that all models are performing better than a random guess.
  
### 2. Flight Delay Prediction Model
- **Description:** Developed regression models to identify key factors associated with flight delays and predict the estimated delay time. The goal was to inform customers as soon as possible, enhancing customer satisfaction and reducing airline costs.
- **Techniques:** Machine Learning (regression models), Parameter Tuning, Feature Engineering
- **Tools:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Highlights:** Demonstrated proficiency in various regression modeling techniques (Linear, Ridge, Lasso) to accurately predict flight delays.

### 3. CFPB Complaints Dashboard
- **Description:** Create a user interactive dashboard that captures a compilation of the complaints data summary where users can quickly identify and capture insights.
- **Techniques:**
  - **Visual Analytics:** Utilized various visualization techniques such as heat maps, bar charts, line graphs, and scatter plots to represent data effectively.
  - **Dashboard Design:** Applied principles of effective dashboard design to enhance user experience and data comprehension.
  - **User Interactivity:** Incorporated interactive elements like filters, parameters, and tooltips to allow users to explore the data dynamically.
- **Tools:** Tableau
- **Highlights:** Increase the model performances by 20% on average, concluding that all models are performing better than a random guess.
